In order to run this project locally, you must first create 2 .env files which will store the environment variables. Open the .env-example and familiarise yourself with the format. You should then create a .env.development file, with the line 'PGDATABASE=', followed by the correct database name for the development database. Similarly, create a .env.test file with the line 'PGDATABASE=', followed by the correct database name for the test database. Names for the respective databases can be found in /db/setup.sql.
